This file will test the functionality of the Vector3 class which
will be used in the Killer1 Engine. Most of the examples and all
of the equations are from 3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game
Development by Dunn and Parberry (awesome book for those who
wish to learn).

Uses the boost test library.
